to run this use

```
docker run 51monfarrow/oystercard
```

the code is a single fsx file and can be run with mono using ```fsharpi oyster.fsx``` there are no external library dependancies

the only part not implemented in this is checking of credit on the oyster card on interaction with the system. I may add that at some point.
